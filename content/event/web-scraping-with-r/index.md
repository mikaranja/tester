title: Web Scraping with R
abstract: >-
  In today's digitally driven era, literacy extends beyond traditional reading
  and writing. The ability to navigate, understand, and harness digital
  information is essential for personal and professional growth. As we celebrate
  International Literacy Day on Friday, 8th September 2023, join me for an
  engaging and enlightening workshop, "Web Scraping in R." This workshop is
  designed to equip participants with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive
  in our interconnected world.


  Together, we will build a more connected, informed, and empowered global community, ready to thrive in our increasingly digital and interconnected world. I look forward to sharing this day of learning and growth with you!
